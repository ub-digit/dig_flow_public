feature_store_page_count_in_model

Store the page_count property in metadata (job_metadata or jobs), exactly where is not decided yet.
Also shopw the page_count property in job view.

I put the code that collects the page_count into the run_mets.rb script, though
it could easily have been put in the mets_control function on job.rb as well,
after the mets control.

I also commented out the zipping of the mets file, which made the testing much faster.
