feature_show_prioritized_jobs_in_list

Adding a priority column to the jobs database table.
This is done by editing the Jobs model class which will
propagate the change down to the database layer.

Also the list of prioritized jobs should show up at the projects page,
that will work as the start page for the system.

Also the jobs in the prioritized list may not have the status "done".

Also added label for the prioritized jobs table.
